# Installation
Currently there is no user-friendly way to do so.
You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with [npm](https://npmjs.com/)) installed.
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/X-Legendary/away-from-discord.git
cd away-from-discord
npm install
npm run build
```
You'll now have a `build` folder with the executable version of the app.

# TODO
- Easier installation
- Create released with prebuilt binaries
